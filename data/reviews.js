    review: `A very handsome scone this one.

After a week away from Ben and Issy, I was beginning to develop some separation anxiety. Fortunately the King had a birthday, which meant the two 9-5ers could escape the Big Smoke (Christchurch) for a weekend in Wanaka.

Spirits were at a low ebb after an unsuccessful mish in the Makaroa the previous evening. Buoyed by forecasts of a stellar Aurora Australis, we'd set out (along with Ben M) for Brewster Hut, only to encounter a critical transmission failure a mere 12 kilometres from the trailhead. It felt like Mt Brewster, just visible at the head of the valley, was laughing at us. But when the Southern Alps are laughing, there's nothing to do but laugh along with them. They're bigger and stronger than you, and they know it.

Marooned roadside, we were left to contend with a vicious sandfly assault while awaiting the tow truck. They almost took Issy, but just as hope was fading, help arrived in the form of Ben M's dad and we scurried 100km back to the safety of wine and biscuits. Of course, we still had all our hiking snacks to get through, so we set about devising a plan for Sunday.

Awaking to reports of low cloud in the Matukituki, we decided to give Rob Roy Glacier a miss and headed instead for Breast Hill. An inspired decision. Ben H went so far as to award this hike a 9/10, only losing points for lack of technicality. Personally I don't feel qualified to comment, having spent most of the ascent thinking about my breakfast.

Whilst Ben H and Issy had elected for Doughbin Pies, and Ben M had gone with the tried-and-true bowl of Weet-Bix, I ventured down the road to Kai Pai Bakery. This decision reaped dividends.

A beautifully consistent texture, thin and crispy crust, paired with a liberal smattering of chives - this was a seriously solid scone underpinned by proper technique. I think this might be a 8.6/10. The setting definitely helped. Nothing like using the warm bonnet of a (functioning) car to spread butter onto a cheese scone as first light spreads across the mesmerising Lake Hawea.

Oh yeah, the walk was fun too. Bonus marks for the cheese and biscuits at the summit.`,

    review: `OUTSTANDING ALERT üö® 

This directly from my notes:

‚ÄúI may have found the cheese scone to end all cheese scones‚Ä¶‚Äù

Is there higher praise? Arguably not. 

What makes this even more remarkable is that I wasn't even hungry when I stumbled into Marmolada. But as any self-respecting cheese scone enthusiast knows, you always keep the scone-stomach empty for intriguing prospects. Today, this strategy paid dividends. With an hour to kill following an unsuccessful attempt to acquire a student season pass (NZSki were not great fans of my definitely-legitimate, totally-not-forged Austrian study letter) I sat down at the neighbouring Marmolada and ordered my usual fare. 

This scone did not disappoint. The smell hits you first. As soon as my waiter rounded the corner, a rich cheesiness assailed my olfactory faculties. A friend recently told me food tastes better when others cook it - something about your nose adapting to smells during cooking. True or not, I was salivating before I'd even touched my butter knife. 

Of course, my Queenstown Cafe experience (see previous post) had taught me that smells can be deceiving. There was no deception on this occasion though. I struggled to find any form of constructive feedback for my hosts. Clearly baked fresh and with a generous smattering of chives and onion that made the tastebuds sing, this baked good was a full-on sensory experience. A thoroughly deserved 9.1/10. 

Why then, I hear you asking, does it not receive a 10? Well, and this may be perceived as intellectually dishonest, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable awarding the perfect score to a scone that has more than just cheese‚Ä¶ Perhaps one day I‚Äôll develop categories. Savoury and Just Cheese would seem like a sensible dichotomy. I can‚Äôt really be bothered though. Besides, scone scoring is more art than science. 

Long story short, if you‚Äôre in Queenstown then Marmoloda is a no-brainer.`,

    review: `Back-to-back bangers in New Zealand‚Äôs adventure capital! Where the previous scone from Marmoloda sought to push the boundaries by injecting spice and everything nice, this iteration from the Beach St Cafe stuck to its guns to produce a traditional beauty. Perfectly

Booked in for another night at the waterfront Absoloot Hotel, I had an empty morning to populate ahead of an ambitious four-day mission to Fiordland. What better way to spend it than ticking off another identified scone opportunity? Word of mouth had it that the nearby Beach St Cafe should be at the very top of the list. So book in hand (*Tangi* by Witi Ihimaera - a poetic reflection on identity in the conflux of Pakeha and Maori cultures) I readied my tastebuds and set out for the impending savoury onslaught. Only one word for this one - yum!  

Perfectly toasted to produce a thin crust, every bite of this goody unlocked a depth of flavour previously unexplored on sconescorer. The only downside? That there wasn‚Äôt more of it! Again, I don‚Äôt yet feel comfortable throwing 10s around, so I‚Äôll dial this one back to a 9.5. In a head-to-head battle though I think it takes the crown from Marmoloda. At the end of the day, visitors to the Wakatipu Basin appear spoilt for choice.`,

    review: `Kia ora all!!

Scone-scorer here! I‚Äôll be posting short written reviews for all the sconnoisseurs out there as I tour Aotearoa searching for the perfect savoury snack. A bit about me to begin with? Nah, this page isn‚Äôt about me. It‚Äôs about you. It‚Äôs about getting you to that ultimate scone, to the comfort of that cheesy, moist dough in a foreign land. 

To get you started on that journey, I‚Äôve unearthed a little gem hidden in the expansive backstreets of Christchurch‚Äôs inner north. I stumbled into Meshino Cafe half delirious after a 2 hour trudge back from an unsuccessful mish to AA in Shirley. The early signs were good. A weatherboard cafe perched elegantly on a quiet street corner, it was clear that the patrons weren‚Äôt just idle passersby. They had come with intention. As I had.

On account of being underdressed for the chill of a late May Cantabrian morning, I made the unusual decision to take this scone home with me. And bloody hell, she can stay! This hunky piece of dough was exactly what I dream about when I think of cheese scones. A simple smattering of chives combined beautifully with an even distribution of cheese and a thin, flaky crust. Hecker, I‚Äôm getting hungry just writing about it! 

After three scone-less days in Aotearoa, this scone crushed the withdrawal shakes. A strong 9/10 to kick off the series. On reflection, I wonder whether Meshino‚Äôs, which sits directly opposite Rugby Park, has any role to play in the Crusaders dominance of Southern Hemisphere Rugby (8 in 9 üèÜ üèÜ üèÜ¬†thanks for coming). If so, then I bet Ethan Blackadder and his boys are ordering the cheese scones each morning. 

Chur bro!`,

    review: `Dejected from my Queenstown Cafe experience, I was idly wandering in the direction of home for the evening (check out the lovely folks at Absoloot Hostel if you‚Äôre in town and in need of a bed for the night) when a glimmer of hope appeared in the corner of my downcast gaze. The Bakery. Any institution that bestows on itself a definite article immediately excites my attention. Given my current preoccupation with the humble scone (I fall asleep dreaming of these things) the pull of attraction to this simple looking facade was magnetic. Alas, I had arrived too late in the afternoon to contemplate the possibility of a double scone day. This was to be a next day mission.

Waking the next morning to a fog-shrouded Queenstown, I was equal parts thankful for yesterday‚Äôs successful aerial reconnaissance mission, and thrilled about the possibility of a redemption scone at THE Bakery. Little birdies had been singing the praises of their pies, so I figured they also excelled in the art of other baked goods, particularly those of the savoury persuasion. For this mission I brought along Tom Holland‚Äôs *Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind*. A rather meaty tome, I was hoping to gain valuable new insight into the foundational precepts of Western thought. Alas my monkey brain and childish aversion to all things spiritual put me off almost from the first page. 

When I reflect upon the merits of the scone, cheerily delivered to my street-facing table warmed and buttered, I wonder if this frame of mind negatively impacted my review. Probably. Nonetheless, I don‚Äôt pretend to be impartial. Nor should anybody else, and if they say they are then they‚Äôre lying. Anyway, dodging that philosophical question I have to say that this scone suffered from the same defects as its local compatriot. The dough was slightly less chewy, but again I could not help but feel they needed to invest in better diary. This was a 4.6/10 in my books. On a side note, and at risk of stepping on the toes of @piemantravels, their pies are delicious. Would highly recommend any visitors come here rather than the  Ferg behemoth directly across Shotover Street (though I have to admit that Fergbaker might do the best pie in the country‚Ä¶)`,

    review: `Queenstown meet scone scorer, scone scorer meet Queenstown. After a tedious 8.5-hour bus ride from Christchurch (thank goodness for the jaw-dropping scenery) I was keen to sink my teeth into the Wakatipu Scone Scene. To identify the best options, I did what any good military general would do and scaled the nearest peak to survey the surrounds.

With my trusty team of goat scouts in tow, I made quick work of Ben Lomond (1748m) and neighbouring Bowen Peak (1630m). Visibility was picture perfect, allowing for detailed note-taking of potential scone opportunities. With such a long list ahead of me, the only logical option was to commence with the town's namesake cafe. Situated somewhat misleadingly on the outskirts of town, the rustic-looking Queenstown Cafe appeared to offer plenty of promise. I don't know if it was the timber or just a hypersensitive nose, but this venue was heavy on smells. Good ones mostly. Rich coffee odours wafted across my windowsill table, intermingling with various scents from a smorgasbord of pie options. As if these olfactory factors weren't sufficient, the odds of a strong scone were heightened by my ravenous hunger (28km and 2000m elevation does that to a man).u

Tragically, however, this scone was unable to rise to the occasion. The texture was doughy and flavours basic. Some chives may have helped, but I left wondering whether a Monday afternoon was the optimal time for a scone. Do bakers bake on a Monday morning? Maybe not if they've just worked both days on the weekend. Or perhaps I'm selling them short. Either way, a harsh - but I think fair - 3.2/10. Will likely get a second chance on account of being close to my bus stop. Would be thrilled to be proven wrong.`,

    review: `Another town, another scone, another success story. These carbs were certainly well-earned. I‚Äôd arrived in Te Anau early on Friday morning with an ambitious agenda. Not just one, but two Great Walks; the Kepler and the Routeburn. The weather window certainly looked favourable, but tackling 100km by foot in Fiordland is never an easy task. Sure enough, my arrival coincided with Te Anau‚Äôs first snow of the season. The ever-trusty DOC workers indicated that the snow line had descended to just 500m. Given a significant proportion of the Kepler would be above 1100m, I decided it might be best to invest in a decent pair of gaiters and ice-spikes. The skies were nonetheless forecast to clear for the weekend, so I set out early Saturday morning for the comfort of Luxmore Hut - one of the few permanently staffed huts in the DOC portfolio. This section of the walk was nothing short of magnificent, but with another 52km to cover back to town, I was hesitant about the idea of spending the next night at the notoriously frigid Iris Burn Hut. 

Time to call in the dog! Twelve hours of walking later - including 10km of alpine ridge line spanning marginal avalanche territory, and more than four hours through dense beech forest by head torch - I‚Äôd arrived back at Lakefront Backpackers. Being 9pm on a Sunday of course, I was left to wait till the morning to commence Operation Re-Carb.  

Sandfly Cafe, conveniently located just before the town‚Äôs optimal hitchhiking spot, looked to offer plenty of promise. Cheerful smiles on entry, always a good start. Big cabinet and busy tables - even better! This cheese scone was megggggaaa. Sure got the carbs up. How about the taste though? Hit that spot too. If I had to be critical, it was trying to do a little too much. Sure, the garlic butter was delicious. But does a cheese scone need flavoured butter? I‚Äôd argue probably not. Unless you‚Äôre in a 2000+ calorie deficit. In that case, play on; 9.2/10. 

SIDENOTE: plenty of talking points from the recent Scone Scorer Summit. Stay tuned for the details.`,

    review: `Well, this was something a little bit different.

I must admit that I ordered this scone feeling a little down in the dumps after missing my usual return bus from Pak'nSave. As they say though, every cloud has a silver lining. In this passing shadow lay the opportunity to sample a new scone. The venue: Bakers Lane - a cafe renowned more for its sweets than its savoury options, but baking is baking, so I figured it would be hard to go far wrong.

With three separate savoury varieties greeting the prospective consumer, the early signs were strong. Of course, this being my first time at Bakers Lane, I confidently ordered the straight-up cheese scone, making a mental note to return for the sun-dried tomato-infused alternative on my next visit. Toasted (not microwaved) and served with a generous heaping of butter (no small fee in this economy), this treat sure looked the part.

On the tongue, it was somewhat reminiscent of campfire damper: crisp outer and almost creamy internal consistency. On reflection though, and through conversation with Macpac colleague and fellow cheese scone enthusiast James, the resemblance may have been made most apparent by my proclivity to add a fraction too much baking soda to my damper mixes. Nonetheless, I'd still 100% recommend Bakers Lane to friends. I'm still not convinced that baking soda creates a wholly unpleasant experience. Plus, it's basically like brushing your teeth without needing to pay for Colgate's.

I appreciate that may sound like an outrageous take. I'm not saying other scone enthusiasts would reach the same conclusion. All I ask is that you approach it with an open mind. A middling 7.2 for me.`,

    review: `Mid-week treat, this one.

An awkward bus timetable gifted me a 30-minute window to explore town before work. For a moment I contemplated going on a walk around Queenstown Gardens, but with so much ground to cover on the cheese scone mission, I couldn't let this moment slide.

Vudu Cafe might be Queenstown's premiere brunch destination. At least that's what I can tell from my vantage point behind the counter of neighbouring Macpac. With ample outdoor seating and voluptuous servings of eggs, I reckon you'd struggle to spend a day in Queenstown poorly just by jumping between Vudu and neighbouring Pogs. And what better way to line the stomach for an afternoon/evening of Guinness than with a cheese scone? Carby, crispy and girthy. It ticks all my boxes at least.

What's more‚Ä¶ this scone had a secret easter egg - a thin layer of ricotta cheese through the middle of the upper crust. Full credit to the Vudu crew for this innovative approach. It certainly created an additional indulgent element for the consumer. Now I don't necessarily believe that this method should displace the tried-and-true, but it's great to see some dynamism in the industry. It also provides an excellent reason to return [SPOILER ALERT: this scone featured @ the Inaugural Scone Scorer Summit. More to come‚Ä¶]

A strong 8.4/10.`,

    review: `How times change!

The highest-ranked scone of the 2022 Strapped Boy's Mission seems to have suffered an unfortunate fall from grace over the intervening three-year period. Perhaps we were a bit naive at the time, or simply under the spell of the Ferg Conglomerate. However, this scone was missing a number of key elements. For starters, and especially for Queenstown's most renowned baking institution, the dough was clearly stale. Yes, the flavours were subtle and pleasant, but for a 24/7 operation I really expected something fresher, not least since I passed through its doors at what should be prime scone consumption hours (mid-morning).

Compared to the neighbouring Beach St Cafe (current leader on our scone leaderboard), this scone was also a little shy on cheese. From my experience, if you're not confident in your dough, then add-more-cheese is usually a decent insurance policy. Poor old Ferg seems stuck in No-Man's Land though. Of course, this critique comes from a place of love. And love brings high expectations! Yes, this scone was lacking in a few key departments. Was it unpleasant though? Definitely not. I'd therefore happily award a pass mark: 5.5/10. Mr and Mrs Ferg though, consider yourselves on notice.`,

    review: `Another Pak N' Save mission, another scone scoring opportunity.

On a rather soggy Saturday, the discount supermarket warehouse's immediate neighbour Columbus Coffee made for an obvious pit-stop. Not usually one for a cafe chain (especially those attached to a hardware store,) I was pleasantly surprised by the array of decent looking cabinet food. Multiple savoury scone varieties normally indicate that the vendor takes their craft seriously. Of course, this heuristic does not apply equally as well to chains. After all, the decision to stock a sun-dried tomato variant alongside the traditional cheese-only affair was probably made by some middle manager sitting in Auckland. The baker, most likely an external contractor, probably couldn't care less. We're a glass half-full kinda page though, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

Much like the Mitre 10 mother store, this scone tried to do everything. Chunky, with generous hunks of cheese fighting for your tastebuds' attention against diced onion, wilted spinach and bits of capsicum, this scone felt more like a meal than a snack. Yet I have to say it was still a good experience. Maybe it was the people-watching: families bribing their young kids with sweet treats to get them to the hardware store, older couples enjoying a cheap weekend brunch and tradies stopping for a pie to get them through a dreaded Saturday shift. Columbus Coffee attracts an authentic cross-section of Central Otago. For a temporary resident of arguably New Zealand's most cosmopolitan town, this was a breath of fresh air.

Overall, while the Columbus Cheese Scone does not reach the level of IKEA Meatballs, I'd still say it's worth a dabble: 6.6/10. I'll be leaving with memories of its customers, rather than the recipe.`,

    review: `New concept unlocked: tomato relish on a scone!

Full credit to Kahwah Cafe on a couple of fronts today. First, for redeeming what was almost an ill-fated cheese scone tour. With my calendar empty ahead of an afternoon shift, I decided to explore the Arthurs Point-Arrowtown trail (17km-ish) on foot with the intention of bagging another scone at the terminus. A cool, crisp winter's morning combined with typically stunning Central Otago scenery and the impressive Millbrook resort to produce a truly joyous jog. A definite 10/10. However, arriving at my destination I was confronted by the troubling reality that Arrowtown Bakery was sold out of cheese scones‚Ä¶ With the clock ticking before the last bus back to work, I unsuccessfully stumbled through two other cafes, before arriving somewhat breathlessly at the bougie-looking Kahwah Cafe to the welcome sight of a scone-full cabinet.

Second, the friendly barista took the as-yet unprecedented step of including a small tub of homemade tomato relish in my takeaway box. My interest piqued, I resisted the temptation to dig in until I arrived home. I then devoured my toasted, buttered and relished scone alongside a characteristically bitter Mocona blend. The verdict: splendid. Purists may object to the additive concept of relish. On one level, I sympathise with this perspective. At what point is a cheese scone more than just a scone? Could relish be used to mask underlying deficiencies? Is a condiment really worth the extra $2? While these prickly questions may threaten to divide the scone community, I think it's important to not lose sight of what is most important - the experience. Approached pragmatically, slapping some relish on this bad-boy improved my morning, its tangy spices complementing the freshness of the dough.

As I spoke about in our Vudu Cafe review, innovation is often lacking in the cheese scone industry. When it pays off, it should be celebrated. At the same time, I do think that Kahwah Cafe has drifted a bit beyond the realm of the cheese scone. If they dialled up the gooey-factor I'd be more inclined to award a higher score. Nonetheless, a very solid 8.1/10 in my books. Judging by the other options in Arrowtown (or the lack thereof), I'd suggest stopping by to make your own mind up if in town.`,

    review: `Road trippppppppp

With the only South Island All Blacks fixture to be played at Forsyth Barr in Dunedin against the Frenchies, I'd made sure to secure tickets (and time off work) well in advance. Borrowing a vehicle off my good friend Ned, I scooped up the cheese-scone-curious Ellie from work (Coronet Peak) and together we set off for the Otago capital. Of course, one of the greatest things about a road trip is the chance to explore new scone opportunities. Assessing the route ahead, we identified the once-bustling gold mining town of Clyde as a convenient first stop. Spoilt for choice on the cafe front, we selected The Post Office, in part because of its thick sandstone exterior, but also because it was the first cafe we passed.

The early signs were good. A roaring fireplace warmed a jovial crowd. In a town numbering just over a thousand, I figured many were embarking on a similar journey to ourselves. Or perhaps they had their own Central Otago objectives. Either way, the mood was infectious. We soon found ourselves faced with a coffee, a hot choccie, and a rustic scone. Concerning the latter, and as I have come to expect with pastries of this ilk, the texture was a little uneven. This is not to say I found this aspect disappointing. With every bite generating slight nuances in mouth-feel, rustic scones have the ability to transport consumers into the baker's process. Scone-scoring is really just a metaphor for life, and as in the biggest of pictures, it is through imperfections that we create character.

What I did find slightly underwhelming, however, was the subdued cheesiness. Part of the joy of a rustic scone is the pleasure of finding an unapologetic chunk of gooey cheese. The Post Office iteration unfortunately did not produce any of these magic moments. That said, I was still delighted with the pit-stop. The rating: 6.8/10. Time now for a Will Jordan hat-trick.

ASIDE: Met two Clyde locals on the chairlift today - both expressed pride in The Post Office and its cheese scone. Big ups for culture.`,

    review: `Woooweee!

A questionable performance from the ABs in their season-opener last night. Job done nonetheless. In truth, the tight scoreline was more a function of an overly-enthusiastic TMO than a strong French performance. Fully expecting a blowout in the second fixture up in Welly.

Anywayyyyss, onto scones. After a few more pints than I have grown accustomed to the previous evening, I had developed an acute hankering for a coffee and scone. After discussing a few potential alternatives in the immediate vicinity of Dunedin, we decided to return to a cafe we had passed on the way into the city the previous evening: Good Earth Cafe.

This venue would not have been out of place in Sydney. With a menu full of wholesome ingredients and large, floor-to-ceiling windows exposing customers to the dim warmth of the early morning rays, I couldn't picture a better spot to nurse a battered soul. While tempted to dabble in an eggs benny, I knew a new destination demanded a new scone. This version took things right down the middle. Not too much cheese, yet at the same time also not enough. Warm, but not crispy. Perhaps this dithering review is more a function of head noise than of sound judgement. However, without any distinguishing features beyond its setting, I can't award it more than a 7.2/10.

ASIDE: I was too scattered to take photographic evidence of this one. Please enjoy this video of the fastest known barefoot ascent of the world's steepest street instead.`,
