    review: `A very handsome scone this one.

After a week away from Ben and Issy, I was beginning to develop some separation anxiety. Fortunately the King had a birthday, which meant the two 9-5ers could escape the Big Smoke (Christchurch) for a weekend in Wanaka.

Spirits were at a low ebb after an unsuccessful mish in the Makaroa the previous evening. Buoyed by forecasts of a stellar Aurora Australis, we'd set out (along with Ben M) for Brewster Hut, only to encounter a critical transmission failure a mere 12 kilometres from the trailhead. It felt like Mt Brewster, just visible at the head of the valley, was laughing at us. But when the Southern Alps are laughing, there's nothing to do but laugh along with them. They're bigger and stronger than you, and they know it.

Marooned roadside, we were left to contend with a vicious sandfly assault while awaiting the tow truck. They almost took Issy, but just as hope was fading, help arrived in the form of Ben M's dad and we scurried 100km back to the safety of wine and biscuits. Of course, we still had all our hiking snacks to get through, so we set about devising a plan for Sunday.

Awaking to reports of low cloud in the Matukituki, we decided to give Rob Roy Glacier a miss and headed instead for Breast Hill. An inspired decision. Ben H went so far as to award this hike a 9/10, only losing points for lack of technicality. Personally I don't feel qualified to comment, having spent most of the ascent thinking about my breakfast.

Whilst Ben H and Issy had elected for Doughbin Pies, and Ben M had gone with the tried-and-true bowl of Weet-Bix, I ventured down the road to Kai Pai Bakery. This decision reaped dividends.

A beautifully consistent texture, thin and crispy crust, paired with a liberal smattering of chives - this was a seriously solid scone underpinned by proper technique. I think this might be a 8.6/10. The setting definitely helped. Nothing like using the warm bonnet of a (functioning) car to spread butter onto a cheese scone as first light spreads across the mesmerising Lake Hawea.

Oh yeah, the walk was fun too. Bonus marks for the cheese and biscuits at the summit.`,

    review: `OUTSTANDING ALERT üö® 

This directly from my notes:

‚ÄúI may have found the cheese scone to end all cheese scones‚Ä¶‚Äù

Is there higher praise? Arguably not. 

What makes this even more remarkable is that I wasn't even hungry when I stumbled into Marmolada. But as any self-respecting cheese scone enthusiast knows, you always keep the scone-stomach empty for intriguing prospects. Today, this strategy paid dividends. With an hour to kill following an unsuccessful attempt to acquire a student season pass (NZSki were not great fans of my definitely-legitimate, totally-not-forged Austrian study letter) I sat down at the neighbouring Marmolada and ordered my usual fare. 

This scone did not disappoint. The smell hits you first. As soon as my waiter rounded the corner, a rich cheesiness assailed my olfactory faculties. A friend recently told me food tastes better when others cook it - something about your nose adapting to smells during cooking. True or not, I was salivating before I'd even touched my butter knife. 

Of course, my Queenstown Cafe experience (see previous post) had taught me that smells can be deceiving. There was no deception on this occasion though. I struggled to find any form of constructive feedback for my hosts. Clearly baked fresh and with a generous smattering of chives and onion that made the tastebuds sing, this baked good was a full-on sensory experience. A thoroughly deserved 9.1/10. 

Why then, I hear you asking, does it not receive a 10? Well, and this may be perceived as intellectually dishonest, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable awarding the perfect score to a scone that has more than just cheese‚Ä¶ Perhaps one day I‚Äôll develop categories. Savoury and Just Cheese would seem like a sensible dichotomy. I can‚Äôt really be bothered though. Besides, scone scoring is more art than science. 

Long story short, if you‚Äôre in Queenstown then Marmoloda is a no-brainer.`,

    review: `Back-to-back bangers in New Zealand‚Äôs adventure capital! Where the previous scone from Marmoloda sought to push the boundaries by injecting spice and everything nice, this iteration from the Beach St Cafe stuck to its guns to produce a traditional beauty. Perfectly

Booked in for another night at the waterfront Absoloot Hotel, I had an empty morning to populate ahead of an ambitious four-day mission to Fiordland. What better way to spend it than ticking off another identified scone opportunity? Word of mouth had it that the nearby Beach St Cafe should be at the very top of the list. So book in hand (*Tangi* by Witi Ihimaera - a poetic reflection on identity in the conflux of Pakeha and Maori cultures) I readied my tastebuds and set out for the impending savoury onslaught. Only one word for this one - yum!  

Perfectly toasted to produce a thin crust, every bite of this goody unlocked a depth of flavour previously unexplored on sconescorer. The only downside? That there wasn‚Äôt more of it! Again, I don‚Äôt yet feel comfortable throwing 10s around, so I‚Äôll dial this one back to a 9.5. In a head-to-head battle though I think it takes the crown from Marmoloda. At the end of the day, visitors to the Wakatipu Basin appear spoilt for choice.`,

    review: `Kia ora all!!

Scone-scorer here! I‚Äôll be posting short written reviews for all the sconnoisseurs out there as I tour Aotearoa searching for the perfect savoury snack. A bit about me to begin with? Nah, this page isn‚Äôt about me. It‚Äôs about you. It‚Äôs about getting you to that ultimate scone, to the comfort of that cheesy, moist dough in a foreign land. 

To get you started on that journey, I‚Äôve unearthed a little gem hidden in the expansive backstreets of Christchurch‚Äôs inner north. I stumbled into Meshino Cafe half delirious after a 2 hour trudge back from an unsuccessful mish to AA in Shirley. The early signs were good. A weatherboard cafe perched elegantly on a quiet street corner, it was clear that the patrons weren‚Äôt just idle passersby. They had come with intention. As I had.

On account of being underdressed for the chill of a late May Cantabrian morning, I made the unusual decision to take this scone home with me. And bloody hell, she can stay! This hunky piece of dough was exactly what I dream about when I think of cheese scones. A simple smattering of chives combined beautifully with an even distribution of cheese and a thin, flaky crust. Hecker, I‚Äôm getting hungry just writing about it! 

After three scone-less days in Aotearoa, this scone crushed the withdrawal shakes. A strong 9/10 to kick off the series. On reflection, I wonder whether Meshino‚Äôs, which sits directly opposite Rugby Park, has any role to play in the Crusaders dominance of Southern Hemisphere Rugby (8 in 9 üèÜ üèÜ üèÜ¬†thanks for coming). If so, then I bet Ethan Blackadder and his boys are ordering the cheese scones each morning. 

Chur bro!`,

    review: `Dejected from my Queenstown Cafe experience, I was idly wandering in the direction of home for the evening (check out the lovely folks at Absoloot Hostel if you‚Äôre in town and in need of a bed for the night) when a glimmer of hope appeared in the corner of my downcast gaze. The Bakery. Any institution that bestows on itself a definite article immediately excites my attention. Given my current preoccupation with the humble scone (I fall asleep dreaming of these things) the pull of attraction to this simple looking facade was magnetic. Alas, I had arrived too late in the afternoon to contemplate the possibility of a double scone day. This was to be a next day mission.

Waking the next morning to a fog-shrouded Queenstown, I was equal parts thankful for yesterday‚Äôs successful aerial reconnaissance mission, and thrilled about the possibility of a redemption scone at THE Bakery. Little birdies had been singing the praises of their pies, so I figured they also excelled in the art of other baked goods, particularly those of the savoury persuasion. For this mission I brought along Tom Holland‚Äôs *Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind*. A rather meaty tome, I was hoping to gain valuable new insight into the foundational precepts of Western thought. Alas my monkey brain and childish aversion to all things spiritual put me off almost from the first page. 

When I reflect upon the merits of the scone, cheerily delivered to my street-facing table warmed and buttered, I wonder if this frame of mind negatively impacted my review. Probably. Nonetheless, I don‚Äôt pretend to be impartial. Nor should anybody else, and if they say they are then they‚Äôre lying. Anyway, dodging that philosophical question I have to say that this scone suffered from the same defects as its local compatriot. The dough was slightly less chewy, but again I could not help but feel they needed to invest in better diary. This was a 4.6/10 in my books. On a side note, and at risk of stepping on the toes of @piemantravels, their pies are delicious. Would highly recommend any visitors come here rather than the  Ferg behemoth directly across Shotover Street (though I have to admit that Fergbaker might do the best pie in the country‚Ä¶)`,

    review: `Queenstown meet scone scorer, scone scorer meet Queenstown. After a tedious 8.5-hour bus ride from Christchurch (thank goodness for the jaw-dropping scenery) I was keen to sink my teeth into the Wakatipu Scone Scene. To identify the best options, I did what any good military general would do and scaled the nearest peak to survey the surrounds.

With my trusty team of goat scouts in tow, I made quick work of Ben Lomond (1748m) and neighbouring Bowen Peak (1630m). Visibility was picture perfect, allowing for detailed note-taking of potential scone opportunities. With such a long list ahead of me, the only logical option was to commence with the town's namesake cafe. Situated somewhat misleadingly on the outskirts of town, the rustic-looking Queenstown Cafe appeared to offer plenty of promise. I don't know if it was the timber or just a hypersensitive nose, but this venue was heavy on smells. Good ones mostly. Rich coffee odours wafted across my windowsill table, intermingling with various scents from a smorgasbord of pie options. As if these olfactory factors weren't sufficient, the odds of a strong scone were heightened by my ravenous hunger (28km and 2000m elevation does that to a man).u

Tragically, however, this scone was unable to rise to the occasion. The texture was doughy and flavours basic. Some chives may have helped, but I left wondering whether a Monday afternoon was the optimal time for a scone. Do bakers bake on a Monday morning? Maybe not if they've just worked both days on the weekend. Or perhaps I'm selling them short. Either way, a harsh - but I think fair - 3.2/10. Will likely get a second chance on account of being close to my bus stop. Would be thrilled to be proven wrong.`,

    review: `Another town, another scone, another success story. These carbs were certainly well-earned. I‚Äôd arrived in Te Anau early on Friday morning with an ambitious agenda. Not just one, but two Great Walks; the Kepler and the Routeburn. The weather window certainly looked favourable, but tackling 100km by foot in Fiordland is never an easy task. Sure enough, my arrival coincided with Te Anau‚Äôs first snow of the season. The ever-trusty DOC workers indicated that the snow line had descended to just 500m. Given a significant proportion of the Kepler would be above 1100m, I decided it might be best to invest in a decent pair of gaiters and ice-spikes. The skies were nonetheless forecast to clear for the weekend, so I set out early Saturday morning for the comfort of Luxmore Hut - one of the few permanently staffed huts in the DOC portfolio. This section of the walk was nothing short of magnificent, but with another 52km to cover back to town, I was hesitant about the idea of spending the next night at the notoriously frigid Iris Burn Hut. 

Time to call in the dog! Twelve hours of walking later - including 10km of alpine ridge line spanning marginal avalanche territory, and more than four hours through dense beech forest by head torch - I‚Äôd arrived back at Lakefront Backpackers. Being 9pm on a Sunday of course, I was left to wait till the morning to commence Operation Re-Carb.  

Sandfly Cafe, conveniently located just before the town‚Äôs optimal hitchhiking spot, looked to offer plenty of promise. Cheerful smiles on entry, always a good start. Big cabinet and busy tables - even better! This cheese scone was megggggaaa. Sure got the carbs up. How about the taste though? Hit that spot too. If I had to be critical, it was trying to do a little too much. Sure, the garlic butter was delicious. But does a cheese scone need flavoured butter? I‚Äôd argue probably not. Unless you‚Äôre in a 2000+ calorie deficit. In that case, play on; 9.2/10. 

SIDENOTE: plenty of talking points from the recent Scone Scorer Summit. Stay tuned for the details.`,

    review: `Well, this was something a little bit different. 

I must admit that I ordered this scone feeling a little down in the dumps after missing my usual return bus from Pak N Save. As they say though, every cloud has a silver lining. In this passing shadow lay the opportunity to sample a new scone. The venue; Bakers Lane - a cafe renowned more for its sweets than its savoury options, but baking is baking so I figured it would be hard to go far wrong.

With three separate savoury varieties greeting the prospective consumer, the early signs were strong. Of course, this being my first time at Bakers Lane, I confidently ordered the straight-up cheese scone, making a mental note to return for the sun-dried tomato infused alternative on my next visit. Toasted (not microwaved) and served with a generous heaping of butter (no small fee in this economy) this treat sure looked the part. 

On the tongue, it was somewhat reminiscent of campfire damper; crisp outer and almost creamy internal consistency. On reflection though, and through conversation with Macpac colleague and fellow cheese scone enthusiast James, the resemblance may have been made most apparent by my proclivity to add a fraction too much baking soda to my damper mixes. Nonetheless, I‚Äôd still 100% recommend Bakers Lane to friends. I‚Äôm still not convinced that baking soda creates a wholly unpleasant experience. Plus its basically like brushing your teeth without needing to pay for Colgates.

I appreciate that may sound like an outrageous take. I‚Äôm not saying other scone enthusiasts would reach the same conclusion. All I ask is that you approach it with an open mind. A middling 7.2 for me.`,

    review: `Mid-week treat this one.

An awkward bus timetable gifted me a 30 minute window to explore town before work. For a moment I contemplated going on a walk around Queenstown Gardens, but with so much ground to cover on the cheese scone mission I couldn‚Äôt let this moment slide.

Vudu Cafe might be Queenstown‚Äôs premiere brunch destination. At least thats what I can tell from my vantage point behind the counter of neighbouring Macpac. With ample outdoor seating and voluptuous servings of eggs, I reckon you‚Äôd struggle to spend a day in Queenstown poorly just by jumping between Vudu and neighbouring Pogs. And what better way to line the stomach for an afternoon / evening of Guinness than with a cheese scone? Carby, crispy and girthy. It ticks all my boxes at least.

Whats more‚Ä¶ this scone had a secret easter egg - a thin layer of ricotta cheese through the middle of the upper crust. Full credit to the Vudu crew for this innovative approach. It certainly created an addition indulgent element for the consumer. Now I don‚Äôt necessarily believe that this method should displace the tried-and-true, but its great to see some dynamism in the industry. It also provides an excellent reason to return [SPOILER ALERT: this scone featured @ the Inaugural Scone Scorer Summit. More to come‚Ä¶]

A strong 8.4/10.`,
